            <p class="kya-hai">How Does Synesthesia Work?</p>
            <p class="para-1">Synesthesia is a phenomenon in which a presentation of a stimulus,
                 or inducer, produces additional phenomenal experiences, or concurrents, for which
                  no physical sensory inputs exist. For instance, the letter “A” may trigger an
                   experience of red color (Hochel and Milán, 2008) even though there is nothing 
                   that can be established as objectively red in the stimulus. Rather, the experience 
                   of color red is created exclusively internally. Synesthetic mappings of the inducing 
                   stimulus and the concurrent experience are automatic and involuntary, unique for 
                   each individual, and generally stable over time (Wollen and Ruggiero, 1983; Baron-Cohen
                    et al., 1987; but see Simner, 2012). The prevalence of synesthesia in the normal
                    population is estimated to be around 1–2% (Simner et al., 2006).</p>

            <p class="para-2">Synesthesia is a unique subject for research particularly because 
                of the additional phenomenal experiences, i.e., the concurrent qualia. How and 
                why phenomenal experience arises is part of the “hard” problem in consciousness 
                research (e.g., Chalmers, 1995). Many requirements that are necessary for us to 
                be conscious of the world around us can be explained in terms of functioning, 
                information processing, circuits or systems—for instance, the integration of 
                information by a cognitive system, deliberate control of behavior, and the 
                reportability of mental states (also, among others, named the “easy” problems 
                of consciousness; Chalmers, 1995). This is the relatively easier problem. However, 
                it has turned out much more difficult to explain the mechanisms of subjective 
                experience or “what things feel like.” Examples of subjective experiences are for 
                instance the experience of seeing red, or the experience of feeling the wind on 
                your face on a sunny day. This aspect of consciousness is considered harder to account for.</p>

            <p class="para-4">In the present work we suggest several additional reasons why 
                synesthesia has merit for research on consciousness. We first review the 
                research on the dynamic and rapidly growing field of the studies of synesthesia 
                to inform the reader of the current state of affairs. We pay specific attention 
                to the role of semantics in synesthesia, which seems important for establishing 
                synesthetic associations in the brain. We then propose that the interplay between 
                semantics and sensory input in synesthesia can be helpful for the studies of the 
                neural correlates of consciousness, especially when making use of ambiguous stimuli 
                for inducing synesthesia. Finally, alterations of functional connectivity and physical 
                network connectivity discovered in the brains of synesthetes can be useful for the 
                studies of consciousness.</p>
