            <p class="kya-hai">Common Myths</p>

            <p class="para-1">Here are some common misconceptions about synesthesia:</p>

            <div class="list-items">
                <ul class="a">- All people with synesthesia experience colored sound:  
                Chromesthesia, or sound-to-color synesthesia, is indeed one of the more common 
                forms of conflated senses. But not every synesthete has chromesthesia. And even 
                among people who do have sound-to-color synesthesia, their experiences are unique. 
                I’ve really enjoyed looking at the sound-to-color paintings of artist and synesthete 
                Melissa McCracken, who appears to have much more blue in her colored hearing 
                than I have. My own chromesthesia tends toward faint yellows, pinks 
                and greens.</ul>

                <ul class="b">- Synesthesia is a beautiful experience: While many synesthetes 
                    do enjoy their synesthesia, it isn’t always pleasant. Earlier this year, 
                    the NPR program Invisbilia profiled a woman whose mirror-touch synesthesia 
                    made it impossible for her to be in the presence of people who were eating, 
                    as it would make her choke and gag. My own mirror-touch includes 
                    synesthesia-for-pain. And some grapheme-color synesthetes dislike many of 
                    the hues in which they see their letters and numbers. Syn isn’t 
                    always pretty.</ul>
                
                <ul class="c">- Synesthesia is a disease: It’s a neurological trait, not an illness.</ul>

                <ul class="d">- Synesthesia is really rare: It’s actually somewhat common, affecting 
                    approximately 4% of the global population.</ul>

                <ul class="e">- Synesthesia isn’t real: At the dawn of modern psychology, interest in 
                    the study of synesthesia was quite high, with some researchers gathering extensive 
                    narratives of synesthetic experiences. Unfortunately, there were no means to 
                    scientifically validate these experiences, and research into synesthesia declined 
                    for decades. With the development of functional magnetic resonance imaging, 
                    synesthesia research has increased dramatically. fMRI studies are documenting how 
                    very real synesthesia is.</ul>
                
                <ul class="f">- There are no tests that prove synesthesia: see above. Also, the 
                    Synesthesia Battery is an online test developed by Dr. David Eagleman. While 
                    it only tests for a few different forms of synesthesia, it’s considered to be q
                    uite accurate.</ul>
